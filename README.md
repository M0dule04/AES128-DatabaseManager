# AES128-DatabaseManager
My grade 11 (South Africa) Practical Assessment Project. Includes AES-128 encryption and dynamic connections to databases. Created solely by me, Derich Havenga

## Purpose of software
To encrypt and decrypt access databases to protect data (dont actually do this, this project is purely for accedemic purposes).

## To use software: 
Log in with credentials
 - use cred as default ADMN0001 - admin

 open the access database(users.mdb) to change cred under build and add a user with the fields (Username, password, access level and a default database) sorry ðŸ˜ž
 
 ### Access levels:
 - 0 admin
 - 1 user/worker (has less privs then admin)
 - 2 survey taker person something, idk man (opens another form with enven less privs!) 
 
 Log in with credentials
 - use cred as default ADMN0001 - admin
